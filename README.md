## Explain

I put together all sorts of scripts to make Windows 10 more efficient. For every script I write Cr. Who made it?
Tweaking will remove Bloatware and Bloatware Regedit.
You should backup your data before using Scripts, as it may delete programs you are using and delete programs loaded through Microsoft Store such as Netfrix, Skype, Spotify, Instargram, etc. Please consult Scripts before using them.

## How did i find specific Tweaks?
<details>
    <summary>How To (Advanced Users)</summary>

By using [SysInternal Suite](https://docs.microsoft.com/pt-br/sysinternals/downloads/sysinternals-suite) `Procmon(64).exe`
i could track the `SystemSettings.exe` by filtering it per Process Name, then `Clearing the list (Ctrl + X)`
(But make sure it is `Capturing the Events (Ctrl + E)`) and finally, applying an option of the Windows Configurations
and searching the Registry Key inside `Procmon(64).exe`.

![Grab the current tweak on registry with Procmon64.exe](./lib/images/Grab-the-current-tweak-on-registry-with-Procmon64.png)

After finding the right register Key, you just need to Right-Click and select `Jump To... (Ctrl + J)` to get on its directory.
